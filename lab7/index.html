		<h1>Lab 7: Functions</h1>
		<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<p>For this lab, we created a Javascript function that takes user input</p>

		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>We only encountered problems once we reached the bonus section. Writing
			the function to take user input, sort it, and return it was no problem.
			However, rewriting the function to deal with spaces and uppercase/lowercase
			was where we got in a bit over our heads. But after wrestling with arrow
			functions and array methods for a while, we finally wrote some working
			code that we understood.</p>

		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>The index.html we wrote is being displayed with the css formatting we
			wrote. Here is the program execution:</p>

		<div class="code">
			<h2>Script Output</h2>
			<script src="js/lab.js"></script>
		</div>

		<h2>Bonus!</h2>
		<p>1. Originally, our code put any uppercase letter before any lowercase
			letter (e.g. "Z" went before "a"). We assume this is because numeric values
			for uppercase ASCII characters are smaller than those for lowercase ones.

			But we fixed this! Thanks to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8996963/how-to-perform-case-insensitive-sorting-array-of-string-in-javascript">ZunTzu on stackoverflow</a>,
			we found a couple javascript tricks to make this possible. Instead of the
			following code to sort the text:</p>

		<div class="code">
			userNameSplit.sort();
		</div>

		<p>We used this code instead:</p>

		<div class="code">
			userNameSplit.sort((a,b) => a.localeCompare(b, undefined, {sensitivity: 'base'}))
		</div>

		<p>The sort method takes a function as an argument for how it should sort the
			array it's given. In this case, we gave it an arrow function that compares
			elements in a case-insensitive way.</p>

		<br>

		<p>2. Our code placed the spaces at the beginning of the array. We made our code
			omit spaces by using the filter array method: </p>

		<div class = "code">
			nameFinalSpaces = userNameSplitSort.filter((value, index, arr) => value != ' ');
		</div>

		<p> This method takes an existing array and a callback function and creates
			a new array based on what the callback function allows. Our callback
			function allows anything that isn't an empty space. </p>
