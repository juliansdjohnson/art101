		<h1>Lab 8: Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>

		<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<p>In this lab, we experimented with anonymous functions and callbacks.</p>

		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p> The primary parts of the lab were fairly straightforward.</p>

		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>The results can be seen on this webpage and in the console log screenshots
			we posted in the PDF file. The bonus problems we did were 1 and 2; 1 can be
			found in the "output" section, and 2 can be found in the button we created
			below.

		</p>

		<h2>Bonus 1</h2>
		<p> The intial error we encountered was that we were trying to assign to a
			variable a value that did not exist under the DOM. After moving
			"<script src="js/lab.js"></script>" to the bottom of the html, it worked.
			We don't totally understand the DOM, but we don't think the DOM sees
			anything after the script tag.

		<h2>Bonus 2</h2>
		<p> We decided to make a simple button that just made a popup. We were
			originally going to make a button that inversed all the colors, but we
			couldn't figure it out. Some nice CSS formatting (thanks, W3 for your
			lovely button) was applied.

		<div id="output"></div>

		<button id="button">Click Me!</button>
