		<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<p> We were to experiment with DOM manipulation using methods such as
			appendChild().</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p> This lab was straightforward as all we had to do was follow the
			instructions.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p> You are looking at the webpage.</p>
		<h2>Bonus 1</h2>
		<p> For this bonus, we used the insertBefore method. This method takes
			two arguments: the element to insert, and the element to insert it before.
			By specifying the element to insert it before to be outputEl.children[0],
			it always goes on top. </p>
