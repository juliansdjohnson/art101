	<div id="textbox">
		<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<p>For this lab, we had to write pseudocode for a task, and convert it to
			JS comments</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>Planting a tree is more complicated than we initially thought. Also,
			converting concrete steps into programming logic was weird.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>Here is our pseudocode as a list and as JS comments:</p>

			<h3>How to plant an oak tree:</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Collect acorns.</li>
				<li>Determine viable acorns:</li>
				<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; padding-bottom: 0;">
  				<li style="margin-left:2em">Place acorns in cold water.</li>
  				<li style="margin-left:2em; padding-bottom: 0;">Discard acorns that float to the top.</li>
 				</ol>
				<li>Fill small pots with potting mix.</li>
				<li>Plant two acorns sideways in each pot, one inch deep.</li>
				<li>Cover pots with screen.</li>
				<li>Keep the soil moist (leave them be in winter)</li>
				<li>If both acorns germinate, cut off the weaker one.</li>
				<li>When seedlings outgrow their pots, transfer them to 2 qt. nursery pots.</li>
				<li>Once saplings outgrow their pots, plant the tree in the ground:</li>
				<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; padding-bottom: 0;">
					<li style="margin-left:2em">Loosen root ball and trim any kinked roots.</li>
					<li style="margin-left:2em">Dig a 4 ft. wide hole as deep as the root ball.</li>
					<li style="margin-left:2em; padding-bottom: 0;">Replace soil on top of the root ball</li>
				</ol>
				<li>Water every week until tree matures</li>

	// If seedlings outgrow their pots, transfer them to 2 qt. nursery pots.
	// If saplings outgrow their pots, plant the tree in the ground:

	// Until trees matures, deeply water tree every week
