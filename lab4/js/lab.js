// Collect acorns.
// Determine viable acorns:
	// Place acorns in cold water.
	// If acorns sink, collect them
// Fill small pots with potting mix.
// Plant two acorns sideways in each pot, one inch deep.
// Cover pots with screen.
// Keep the soil moist:
  // If it's winter, don't water them
  // If it's spring, frequently water saplings until root ball is saturated
// If both acorns germinate, cut off the weaker one's stem.
// If seedlings outgrow their pots, transfer them to 2 qt. nursery pots.
// If saplings outgrow their pots, plant the tree in the ground:
	// Loosen root ball and trim any kinked roots
	// Dig a 4 ft. wide hole as deep as the root ball
  // Replace soil on top of the root ball
// Until trees matures, deeply water tree every week
